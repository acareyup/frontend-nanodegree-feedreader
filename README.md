# Project Overview

This is a Udacity Front End Nanodegree Project upon Jasmine testing skills. Following tasks are needed to be done in order to complete the project.

1. Edit the `allFeeds` variable in **./js/app.js** to make the provided test fail and see how Jasmine visualizes this failure in your application.
2. Return the `allFeeds` variable to a passing state.
3. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
4. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
5. Write a new test suite named `"The menu"`.
6. Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how we're performing the hiding/showing of the menu element.
7. Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.
8. Write a test suite named `"Initial Entries"`.
9. Write a test that ensures when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container.
10. Write a test suite named `"New Feed Selection"`.
11. Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function that the content actually changes.
